# 2D Nesting Tool for Cloth Fabric Cutting

A simple web-based UI for cloth fabric cutting with 2D nesting capability. This tool allows users to upload DLX and RUL files and generate HLt output files.

## Features

- File upload interface for DLX and RUL files
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Simple menu navigation
- Output generation (UI only, functionality not implemented)

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Upload a DLX file by clicking on the upload area or dragging and dropping
3. Upload a RUL file similarly
4. Click the "Process Files" button (functionality not implemented)
5. Once processed, download the resulting HLt file

## Files

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `styles.css` - CSS styling
- `script.js` - JavaScript for UI interactions
- `upload-icon.svg` - Upload icon for the interface

## Note

This is a UI-only implementation. The actual file processing functionality is not implemented.

## Future Improvements

- Implement actual file processing
- Add file validation
- Add user authentication
- Implement project saving and loading
- Add visualization of the nesting process
